            <p class="about-text">Hi! Welcome to the website. Just a little bit about what you might find here...</p>
            <p class="about-text">I've always been fascinated with user-centered design. Here, I think I've finally found an outlet to explore that. </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                I care immensely about clean, functional interfaces that people find a joy
                to work with/use. More than just a portfolio to showcase my work, I want people to be able to interact with my work. I hope people get to actually create something with their interactions here.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">In this bundled, jumbled collection of stuff,
                you'll find games to pass the time, opportunities to make music, and a platform to create and experience an iconic movie moment from new perspectives. This web project is all about exploration - so, go ahead, explore! </p>
            <p class="about-text">At the end of the day, I hope my work speaks for itself.</p>
            <p class="about-text">If you want to see my credentials, check out my <a class="about-link" href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-kong target="_blank">LinkedIn,</a></p>
            <p class="about-text">If you want to know how I am in real life, DON'T look at my Instagram.</p>
            <p class="about-text">Instead, feel free to send me an <a class="about-link" href=mailto:gabrielmkong@gmail.com target="_blank">email</a> - always love getting to meet new people.</p>
